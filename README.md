Implement a design from scratch project
0. Read and be familiar with Figma
mandatory

If you can’t access to it, please find here the Figma file
1. Header
mandatory
Building a web page the right way, is not easy - except if you put in place strong foundations:

reset CSS styling
use variables
simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
Last advice: Personally, I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom. But you can try to other way - it’s fine - but you should structure the way that you will implement a component and not get lost with HTML tags.

Now, your turn!

For this first task: create the header/hero piece

Here an archive of all assets needed: images_.zip
2. "What we do..." section
mandatory
Copy files from the previous task.

For this second task: create the “What we do…” section

In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: holberton_school-icon.zip Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.

Important: try to build as generic as you can… you will probably need some components in next section.

3. "Our results" section
mandatory
Copy files from the previous task.

For this third task: create the “Our results” section

Now you can reuse components form the previous task!
4. Contact us
mandatory
Copy files from the previous task.

A good landing page has always a contact form.

You are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.
